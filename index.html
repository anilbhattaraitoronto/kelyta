                    <p>Kayleen Trajtman is the creative entrepreneur behind Kelyta's Creation. Kayleen started to
                        launch
                        her children's clothing line in Canada at St Mary's Parish in Barrie. Father Sheehy and the
                        patrons
                        of the church allowed her to display communion dresses at church after mass.</p>
                    <p>People at church loved her beautiful designs and from that blessed beginning she worked hard to
                        promote Kelyta's Creation and two years later she went into the wholesale business and then in
                        2006
                        she launched her retail stores and the rest is now part of her successful history.</p>

                        wasn't
                        entirely happy with the colour. I contacted the owner today and within an hour she had not only
                        found a colour I love, she contacted her suppliers and found the exact dress in that colour!
                        Now
                        that is customer service! She takes the time to get to know what you want and is super
                        friendly! I
                        can't recommend her enough!"</p>

                    <p>I wanted to take a moment to submit a review! I found my wedding dress at Kelyta's and not only
                        was
                        my dress incredible, but she and her daughter were amazing to work with! My bridesmaid, maid of
                        honour and my baby (our ring bearer!) also found their dresses/ suits there! These ladies are
                        phenomenal to deal with and made our experience so special and memorable! I would definitely
                        recommend Kelyta's to anyone - you won't be disappointed! Thank you so much ladies!"</p>
